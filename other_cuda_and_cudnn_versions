assuming you have a different version of cudnn this set of commands will help preventing errors:

go to the shared directory and paste the cuda install file you used for you local cuda version i.e.:
tar xvzf cudnn-8.0-linux-x64-v6.0.tgz
cd cuda
cp include/cudnn.h /usr/local/cuda/include
cp -f lib64/*.* /usr/local/cuda/lib64/
chmod a+r /usr/local/cuda/include/cudnn.h /usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcudnn*

then you can run jupyter and verify that 
import keras does not run into errors

good luck!
